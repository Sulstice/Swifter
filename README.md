**Background:** A unique look into scraping data for jobs, the motivation behind this project is to gain 
an outlook about talent pool within a city. In combination with not only the talent pool here but what is up and coming in 
the pipelines of universities. 

**Goal:** Come up with metrics on what a citie's talent pool is looking for and determine what is needed down the pipeline. 


Questions arise:
    - How do we fetch data? 
    
Using the method of scraping (name idea came from the company swiffer and myself scraping dirt off a balcony)
